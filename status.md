## Candidate326: missing parsed sink FRL capability

Run `ae140e354078862907129ed11b2d7e44`, source `8b671fa`, metal-174.
4K120 passes the1217MHz range but DC stream validation returns6 (encoder
validation failure): signal4/TMDS,11880000 in100Hz units, RGB/Y444,8bit.
No DSC requested. HPO encoder exists. Read-only QEMU memory shows preferred and
verified FRL rates zero, sink byte0x887 zero, despite captured HF-VSDB advertising
rate6. Native EDID bridge0x74ada never copies FRL max rate to caps+0x7f;
detection0x16f799 requires that field before native FRL training.
Next copy only checksum-validated advertised FRL rate through the bridge,
preserving native training and bandwidth validation. No HiDPI120 progress yet.

Display-awake assertions verified; current HiDPI1080 at60Hz. Final valid
CORE_PROBE_PASS; guest-request shutdown; recovered/authorizes_launch=true;
audio errors=[] and DMA off. No reboot/rebind; no VM running.
1022 host tests OK,3 skipped. Evidence: candidate-326-results receipts,
c326-link-caps.json and c326-display-modes.txt under ~/macos-vm/run/.
Initial launch failed at source-digest admission before exposure; corrected
card uses the canonical source-tree digest. It consumed no GPU ledger entry.

## Verified progress

| Area | Evidence and scope |
|---|---|
| Managed texture ownership | 96 cases;111,658,032 pixel comparisons; synchronized CPU writes and retained LOAD color contents, zero mismatches |
| Cross-process GPU events | Typed XPC import;33 consumer-first transfers,25,453,131 correct pixels |
| Two-process IOSurface | 32 bidirectional GPU-copy rounds;49,363,648 pixels, zero mismatches; host completion orders transfers |
| Depth/stencil/MSAA | 128 cases at1×/4× and64×64/1003×769;49,625,792 correct pixels |
| Main10 decode | 32 frames, 720p/1080p, 71,884,800 full-plane luma/chroma samples, exact software-reference match |
| Buffer/address reuse | 512 measured rounds, 2,147,483,648 correct values; all 6,144 measured address assignments reused earlier ranges; allocation returns exactly to 544,768 bytes |
| Larger allocations | 192 MiB live resources, four measured rounds, 67,108,864 correct values, exact allocation return |
| Native reclaim | 81 traced calls: 41 true, 40 false; all 40 false returns followed by same-thread/map success; 1,525 internal wire failures observed |
| GPU fences | 128 untracked blit/compute/blit rounds, 134,217,728 correct values; prior cross-queue shared-event checks also pass |
| Native desktop | Three minutes of moving/resizing native material windows; four clean raw RFB captures |
| Safari | Two-minute transparency/blur/scrolling page; three clean captures plus clean desktop after larger-buffer pressure |
| Stock QEMU / PerfPowerServices | OpenCore/VirtualSMC fix passes two guest boots,0.0% CPU, latest0.86s; prior patched-QEMU evidence retained separately |
| Host regression | 1022 tests OK, three skipped |

Earlier texture recreation (144 cases / 131,031,576 pixels), feedback rendering
(48 cases / 5,280,000 pixels), and hardware H.264/HEVC encode/decode retain their
separately documented passing scopes. Explicit decoder GPU-ID selection remains
a selection limitation on the built-in topology; automatic required-hardware selection works.

Default experiment pin now selects this stock image. VirtualSMC1.3.7/gen2 and the
exact OpenCore DSDT ownership patch are required; prior media backups remain available.

## Remaining roadmap

1. Sustained4K remote delivery and input latency; preserve crisp Retina60Hz,
   then qualify login persistence.90/120Hz modes remain unproven.
2. Guest-crash/command-channel failure, repeated lifecycle and independent-host-boot
   qualification. Existing clean stops do not qualify every failure mode.
3. Broader applications, render hazards, interprocess synchronization and page-table
   release. Historical direct OpenGL hang and live Metal validation crash remain open.
4. HiDPI1080 at120Hz, DisplayPort, broader monitors, other hypervisors and measured
   performance/release qualification. Samsung HDMI picture/audio have scoped passes.

StockQEMU10.1.2/OpenCore/VirtualSMC1.3.7 works in this tested setup;
PerfPowerServices was0.0% CPU on two guest boots. Automatic required-hardware HEVC
decode works; explicit GPU-ID selection remains limited. Main10 decode has scoped
passes; hardware encode is Main8. [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

After milestones update current docs, integrate/push dev and synchronize the local
checkout. Do not push main without new authorization. Prior live entries are [archived](findings/research/status-archives/status-before-display-port-20260917.md)
