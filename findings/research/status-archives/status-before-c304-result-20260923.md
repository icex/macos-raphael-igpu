## Candidate 303: GPINT version query also times out

Run `7504daed4a1643f8d93654368fa36208`, metal-151, source `1de97f0`,
boot `dc8add85-5070-419f-959d-6cc094c914be`, MODE2 #224.

- **Functional:** GET_FW_VERSION sent through GPINT before native display init;
  no acknowledgment in 100ms (0x80000 -> 0x10010000, SCRATCH7 stays zero).
  After-init query refuses the still-busy channel. CNTL=0x900c6, CNTL2=0.
  Inbox delivery disabled. Hardware timer progress is not firmware liveness.
- **Capture:** CORE_PROBE_PASS; final critical count 425. Physical picture remains
  unconfirmed; no HDMI audio qualification.
- **Shutdown/recovery:** exited-after-guest-request, recovered,
  authorizes_launch=true. Post-run SMU query succeeds; no guest running.
- **Next:** source-backed normal display-idle exit through the separate Raphael
  VBIOS SMU mailbox, then observe GPINT acknowledgment. Linux dcn315 clock manager
  sends SetDisplayIdleOptimizations(0) when entering mission mode. This is distinct
  from starting/resetting DMCUB, which remains prohibited. Transport/address and
  protocol validation required before exposure; no reboot requirement inferred.

Evidence: `~/macos-vm/run/candidate-303-results/`,
`~/macos-vm/run/c303-post-mode2-probe.json`.
302 proved reversible CPU inbox access and full command readback but timed out
waiting for consumption. [Source audit](findings/research/host-dmcub-tmr-overlap-20260923.md).
Development stays on dev in candidate worktrees, with a remote pull before each
candidate; SSH push works. Main unchanged. Host suite: 1006 tests OK, three skipped.

## Verified progress

| Area | Evidence and scope |
|---|---|
| Managed texture ownership | 96 cases;111,658,032 pixel comparisons; synchronized CPU writes and retained LOAD color contents, zero mismatches |
| Cross-process GPU events | Typed XPC import;33 consumer-first transfers,25,453,131 correct pixels |
| Two-process IOSurface | 32 bidirectional GPU-copy rounds;49,363,648 pixels, zero mismatches; host completion orders transfers |
| Depth/stencil/MSAA | 128 cases at1×/4× and64×64/1003×769;49,625,792 correct pixels |
| Main10 decode | 32 frames, 720p/1080p, 71,884,800 full-plane luma/chroma samples, exact software-reference match |
| Buffer/address reuse | 512 measured rounds, 2,147,483,648 correct values; all 6,144 measured address assignments reused earlier ranges; allocation returns exactly to 544,768 bytes |
| Larger allocations | 192 MiB live resources, four measured rounds, 67,108,864 correct values, exact allocation return |
| Native reclaim | 81 traced calls: 41 true, 40 false; all 40 false returns followed by same-thread/map success; 1,525 internal wire failures observed |
| GPU fences | 128 untracked blit/compute/blit rounds, 134,217,728 correct values; prior cross-queue shared-event checks also pass |
| Native desktop | Three minutes of moving/resizing native material windows; four clean raw RFB captures |
| Safari | Two-minute transparency/blur/scrolling page; three clean captures plus clean desktop after larger-buffer pressure |
| Stock QEMU / PerfPowerServices | OpenCore/VirtualSMC fix passes two guest boots,0.0% CPU, latest0.86s; prior patched-QEMU evidence retained separately |
| Host regression | 965 tests OK, three skipped |

Earlier texture recreation (144 cases / 131,031,576 pixels), feedback rendering
(48 cases / 5,280,000 pixels), and hardware H.264/HEVC encode/decode retain their
separately documented passing scopes. Explicit decoder GPU-ID selection remains
a selection limitation on the built-in topology; automatic required-hardware selection works.

Default experiment pin now selects this stock image. VirtualSMC1.3.7/gen2 and the
exact OpenCore DSDT ownership patch are required; prior media backups remain available.

## Remaining roadmap

1. Sustained4K remote delivery and input latency; preserve crisp Retina60Hz,
   then qualify login persistence.90/120Hz modes remain unproven.
2. Guest-crash/command-channel failure, repeated lifecycle and independent-host-boot
   qualification. Existing clean stops do not qualify every failure mode.
3. Broader applications, render hazards, interprocess synchronization and page-table
   release. Historical direct OpenGL hang and live Metal validation crash remain open.
4. Physical DCN output, other hypervisors and measured performance/release qualification.

StockQEMU10.1.2/OpenCore/VirtualSMC1.3.7 works in this tested setup;
PerfPowerServices was0.0% CPU on two guest boots. Automatic required-hardware HEVC
decode works; explicit GPU-ID selection remains limited. Main10 decode has scoped
passes; hardware encode is Main8. [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

After milestones update current docs, integrate/push dev and synchronize the local
checkout. Do not push main without new authorization. Prior live entries are [archived](findings/research/status-archives/status-before-display-port-20260917.md)
