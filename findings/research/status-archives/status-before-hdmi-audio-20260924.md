## Candidate322: native1080p interleaving fixed; HiDPI120 and HDMI audio required

Run0cb060da92bd7d7a2afdb4dd7002f54b, MODE2#250, sourcebd981b1, metal170.
`rgpuhdmideep=1` matches PHY pixel resync to HDMI deep-color packing. Native
1920x1080@60: user confirms "Yes, picture is correct". Native1920x1080@120:
macOS reports120Hz, PHY ratio1 matches10-bit HDMI, user says "I think120hz works too".
This is physical user observation, not measured frame delivery or color accuracy.
Candidate321 already gave an almost-perfect1080HiDPI picture at60Hz.

Required next: 1920x1080 logical /3840x2160 backing at120Hz, and HDMI audio.
Samsung EDID advertises4K120 VIC118 and FRL12Gbps x4, but macOS only exposes4K30/60.
Native1080p120 does not satisfy HiDPI120. Audio7b:00.1 remains host-owned,
not passed through; existing USB/BlackHole routing is not HDMI audio.

FinalCORE_PROBE_PASS; complete capture; exited-after-guest-request;
recovered/authorizes_launch=true. No VM running.1020 host tests OK,3 skipped.
Evidence: [deep-color and audio follow-up](findings/research/hdmi-deepcolor-120-audio-20260924.md).
Fresh candidates from fetched dev; autonomous tests/resets, no reboot or host sudo.

## Verified progress

| Area | Evidence and scope |
|---|---|
| Managed texture ownership | 96 cases;111,658,032 pixel comparisons; synchronized CPU writes and retained LOAD color contents, zero mismatches |
| Cross-process GPU events | Typed XPC import;33 consumer-first transfers,25,453,131 correct pixels |
| Two-process IOSurface | 32 bidirectional GPU-copy rounds;49,363,648 pixels, zero mismatches; host completion orders transfers |
| Depth/stencil/MSAA | 128 cases at1×/4× and64×64/1003×769;49,625,792 correct pixels |
| Main10 decode | 32 frames, 720p/1080p, 71,884,800 full-plane luma/chroma samples, exact software-reference match |
| Buffer/address reuse | 512 measured rounds, 2,147,483,648 correct values; all 6,144 measured address assignments reused earlier ranges; allocation returns exactly to 544,768 bytes |
| Larger allocations | 192 MiB live resources, four measured rounds, 67,108,864 correct values, exact allocation return |
| Native reclaim | 81 traced calls: 41 true, 40 false; all 40 false returns followed by same-thread/map success; 1,525 internal wire failures observed |
| GPU fences | 128 untracked blit/compute/blit rounds, 134,217,728 correct values; prior cross-queue shared-event checks also pass |
| Native desktop | Three minutes of moving/resizing native material windows; four clean raw RFB captures |
| Safari | Two-minute transparency/blur/scrolling page; three clean captures plus clean desktop after larger-buffer pressure |
| Stock QEMU / PerfPowerServices | OpenCore/VirtualSMC fix passes two guest boots,0.0% CPU, latest0.86s; prior patched-QEMU evidence retained separately |
| Host regression | 1020 tests OK, three skipped |

Earlier texture recreation (144 cases / 131,031,576 pixels), feedback rendering
(48 cases / 5,280,000 pixels), and hardware H.264/HEVC encode/decode retain their
separately documented passing scopes. Explicit decoder GPU-ID selection remains
a selection limitation on the built-in topology; automatic required-hardware selection works.

Default experiment pin now selects this stock image. VirtualSMC1.3.7/gen2 and the
exact OpenCore DSDT ownership patch are required; prior media backups remain available.

## Remaining roadmap

1. Sustained4K remote delivery and input latency; preserve crisp Retina60Hz,
   then qualify login persistence.90/120Hz modes remain unproven.
2. Guest-crash/command-channel failure, repeated lifecycle and independent-host-boot
   qualification. Existing clean stops do not qualify every failure mode.
3. Broader applications, render hazards, interprocess synchronization and page-table
   release. Historical direct OpenGL hang and live Metal validation crash remain open.
4. Physical DCN output, other hypervisors and measured performance/release qualification.

StockQEMU10.1.2/OpenCore/VirtualSMC1.3.7 works in this tested setup;
PerfPowerServices was0.0% CPU on two guest boots. Automatic required-hardware HEVC
decode works; explicit GPU-ID selection remains limited. Main10 decode has scoped
passes; hardware encode is Main8. [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

After milestones update current docs, integrate/push dev and synchronize the local
checkout. Do not push main without new authorization. Prior live entries are [archived](findings/research/status-archives/status-before-display-port-20260917.md)
and [earlier](findings/research/status-archives/status-before-night-close-20260916.md).
